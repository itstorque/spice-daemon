  # Enter any other circuit parameters you want to use. e.g.
  L: 1 # you can put an inductor and set its inductance to \{L\} and it would be 1H
  
modules:
  # all the spice-daemon elements you want to add from spice-daemon into LTspice
  # they will be accessible from the LTspice components menu. 
  # Check under the components defined in your local directory not LTspice

  # To create two spice-daemon elements you can access in LTspice
  # put the type under modules (make sure to not have two separate noise_source entries)
  noise_sources:
  
    # create a noise_source called 'my_noise_source_1' with the following params
    my_noisy_source_1:
      source_type: voltage
      noise:
        type: gaussian
        mean: 0
        std: 2
       
    # create another noise source with a different name

      noise:
        type: gaussian
        mean: 0
        std: 2
      
toolkits:
  # toolkits are python side computations such as postprocessing data,
  # generating a matplotlib plot that accompanies your circuit or generating
  # tables for LTspice. Everything that isn't an LTspice component.
